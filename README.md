# ImageAnalysis


The aim of this repo is to collate scripts that we use in our work.

Most of the scripts are generic and can be used as is, or use as a starting point for a related analysis task.
More specialised scripts are typically in their own repo or associated with a paper repo.

Very useful stuff is in [imagej-macros](https://github.com/quantixed/imagej-macros) and in the **quantixed** ImageJ Update Site for Fiji.

Scripts are organised by topic.

- Coloc
- Filtering
- Measuring
- Metadata
- ROIs
- Templates
- Tracking
- Utility

Note that some scripts may overwrite the input data.
Take time to read the comments and ensure you understand the purpose of the script and always use a copy of primary data as input.
